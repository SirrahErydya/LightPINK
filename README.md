# LightPINK (WIP)
LightPINK is a lightweight tool to visualize and interact with Self-Organizing Kohonen Maps (SOM) created with [PINK](https://github.com/HITS-AIN/PINK). It follows the brush-and-link paradigm, thus allows you to explore a dataset organized by a SOM, choose points of interest and inspect them in a wider space.

**This work is currently WIP**

Looking for a comprehensive application to manage, train, and explore SOMs? Check out [UltraPINK](https://github.com/SirrahErydya/UltraPINK).
